									<h2>Blazor Comic Web App</h2>
									<p>
										Creating my classes and models using entity framework. Then I added my superhero API controller with mock data using crud operations.
										The superhero controller inherited from controller base. We have a route that comes from our API superhero controller which is a public class.
 										In my API superhero controller, I made a public static class which consists of a list of comics Using my dependency injection to allow global http using statements in my program.cs The comics are given ids with 2 different comic sectors which are marvel and dc.
 										Making another public static method for returning or viewing the superhero’s first name last name hero name and comic book Id for having reference to my API.
 										I next made a public async task-action result, for using a Get call for returning a list of SuperHero’s.
 										Then I specified my HttpGet method which I was able to give a return of a status code 200 ok for the heroes Next, I made another HttpGet method to return a list of single heroes with an id for and attribute.
										It’s given a route that has the I’d.
										<br>
 										Made a method for an IF statement if the hero is not there.
 										I test my application and pull up my developer tools then check my network tab to see, that I’m getting the correct status codes and correct API calls, checking the console for any spelling or grammar errors.
 										Next, I added a next page with a razor component, then I have the page a route for my superhero’s I used an already generated code from my nav menu coping the bootstrap code to comply with my superhero as an href called it superheroes to give another nav menu.
 										In my superhero razor I added my html to add tables which consists of First Name Last Name Hero Name and ComicType making edit buttons delete buttons Next, I made a new folder for services.
 										Which had a superhero interface and another superhero service which implements the ISuperhero service. Next in my program.cs I added a builder.services.add scoped to return my interface which also used dependency injection using a global using statement.
 										I injected my ISuperhero service into my superheroes.razor page In my public interface, using crud operations for receiving lists of superhero’s and comics.
 										The methods I used were task GetComics and task GetSuperHeroes and finally get single hero with an id.
 										I implemented my interface in my SuperHeroServices next I initialized my superhero with a new list along with the comics.
 										I made a constructor for the SuperHeroServices and inject the http client class. Now I now able to use an asynchronous task for results from my Http_GetFromJsonAsync reference the list of superheroes and given a route for the API/superheroes.
 										Finally using an IF statement that I’d our superhero is not null we return our result.
										 <br>
 										I next made a for each statement for the hero in the SuperHeroServices returning all the given data first name last name HeroName with the name of the comic.
 										In my superhero.razor page in my code block we used a lifecycle method on async.
 										I used three of them which were protected overrride and async on initialize.
 										Where I used another Getsuperheroes method. Next I added another page that was a razor component, using a page directive for the hero and another for the hero id where we can’t create a new hero.
 										I injected the interface SuperHeroService from SuperHeroService.
 										In my code block I used a parameter attribute for the public int I’d.

 										Next making a IF statement if the ID is null we can’t create a new superhero.
 										And an else statement if I wanted to edit the superhero. In my code block I made a method for making new superhero’s and initialized the new comic for a select box that gets added to my edit form.
 										I created a button with an edit and using a lambda expression for an onclick that gets a method called ShowHero with a hero id.
 										Using a void show hero method to navigate applying a navigationManager to use our method.
 										Next, I went back into my SuperHeroService and added a Getsingle hero method with an id.
 										Which returns my result.
 										Also made a new exception that if the hero is not found.
 										We add the method to our hero page and added my protected override on parameter async method using an if statement to check if the id is null then we create a new hero.
 										And an else statement with the await key word to return a single hero with a casting and integer id.
 										I made an edit form that uses a model of hero that has an onSubmit, which gets a method for handling onSubmit which is retuning a async task. In my edit form model, I make a label and inputText which is using a bind-value to display the first name and a class for form control from bootstrap 5.
 										Again, for the first name last name and hero name. Making an input select binding the values for the hero comic id, a class of form select.
 										A foreach statement for the comics in the SuperHeroService, giving it option with the value of comic id to display the comic’s name.
 										I then created a submit button with a type of submit.
										So that way not every button submits my form.
										In my code block I added a string btnText to be empty and initialized it with a protected overrride async task on initializedAsync and set the button type that if the id is null, we can save a new hero or update the hero.
 										Using the key word await from the SuperHeroService a Getcomic method.
 										Finally adding a route to our SuperHeroService Getcomics to return the results.
 										Next, I added a new method in my superhero controller using httpGet with an id of comics.

									<h2>ASP.NET MVC Jokes Application</h2>

									<p>
										Asp.net core web application in C# using the model view controller and SQL. I changed the authentication to individual user account, that way it creates a database and the tables for me. First I created a new model in the folder with a class which I named Joke. The object oriented programming, in the Joke class I created a public get and set as and integer for the ID, next a public string with a jokeQuestion and jokeAnswer. With an empty constructor method. Next I made some webpages dynamically, in my controller I addded a new controller using entity framework with an MVC. I selected the model which is Joke and added a data context class so it can create properties based on my jokes, naming it JokesWebApp.Data.ApplicationDbContext. Doing this gives me a new controller called jokes which also gives me 4 new pages consisting of Create, Delete, Details, Edit, and Index with the extension cshtml. Next in my output I went into my package manager console, typing add-migrations and giving it a name called initial setup, and updated the data base, I used object relation mapper to be able to take my properties in make a nice table out of it. Now in the sql server explore we can see the SQL tables according to my database. I added a link at the top from a nav-bar using some of the code from the shared folder in the layout.cshtml I copied some bootstrap editing I changed the asp-controller to Jokes and the action changed to index and named the link Jokes. I copied an pasted another link from the same bootstrap from the jokes controller code and adjusted the asp-action to ShowSearchForm. To be able to use the link in my JokesController I copy and pasted a Get method and modified it named ShowSearchForm and changing the return view as an empty view. Next in my Get method I added a razor with a view. In the razor view name is ShowSearchForm, and in the template I set it to create. And used the Joke model and a partial view so it can be apart of the template. This gave me a full input data entry form. I modified the ShowSearchForm, I changed the labels form group to say label for=“SearchPrase” and the input=“SearchPrhase” I modified the form asp-action to ShowSearhResults. Next I back into my Jokes controller and copy and pasted another Get method changed it to a Post method and used it as a model it’s got a public async Task IActionResults to ShowSearchResults added a string with a SearchPhrase method. Using my original index method I copied the return code which gives me a list of Jokes. I used an optional parameter with the index view I inserted a condition “where and used arrow function contains the SearchPhrase filters the list with only the items that contain the specified results. Next In my jokes folder in my index page I removed the joke answer so that it’s not given away on the initial page, and in the foreach section I also removed the JokeAnswer. That way if you want to see the answer you must go into the details page. Next I created an authenticity function so that you must use an email and password to be able to make modifications on the Jokes database. In my Jokes controller I find the action called create, delete post edit and add a decorator in the square brackets called Authorize. I imported the Using statement called Microsoft.AspNetCore.Athorization you now can see your name and be able to edit create or delete, for security. And now we can see our Jokes in the database or our web application.

										 <p class="mb-0">The program uses code first generated code to gernerate some simple object and a contructor along with our database. Based on jokes with Joke Questions and Joke Answers being able to collect all of your best humor. This web app uses migrations to collect and create a database, along with authenticity to only allow users to make changes in the database.

									<h2>Api Video Game Dashboard</h2>
									<p>
										Angular 11 for my project set up I used Node JS and visual studio code, using angular cli and NPM packages. And for styling I used SCSS. I used the cli to download angular material and angular gauge to display the ratings of the games. Next I imported all the modules in my app.module. I used HttpClient module and all the external modules. I added all the modules into the imports array. The first component I created search bar. I took the selector of the component and added it to the app.component.html Here I made a div with a class of search-container in it we have a form-class with a logo and a router link. My input class gets a search-input which has name search function from my ngModel Giving the app a submit button which submits my form. Submitting using ngSubmit and using the form as an argument. In the search bar component, we inject angular router as a dependency, and we can now use this to re direct to our search page also to get our input from the form as an argument. I used the OnSubmit ngForm as a router to use as a search. Next, I created a home component then I made routes for the components and a router outlet so that both pages can be loaded in the router outlet. I’m my home component I made a div with a class of filter and mat-label for sorting, from the ngModel I input the name, release, added, created, updated, ratings, finally the meta critic in my mat-option. I to connect the mat-select by adding it to my home-component ts file. In the home component I have a game class which contains a description, thumbnails, the name of the game and the platforms that support each game. The game cards were styled in my home component scss. Next, I made my services to fetch the URL. Using angular cli I created an http it gets injected into the services

										The method I used was GetGameList calling from the home component, which then fetches the list of the games, it gets two parameter which was ordering and search from the Observable APIResponse from Game. I added some HttpParams to and now I can get the search results from the http get APIResponse game interface, the base URL is in the environment file, and it gets a route of Games. I created the base URL constant that was implemented and imported into the environment.ts and environment.prod.ts I used it as an end. Next, I made new files for the interfaces of model.ts it’s the main interface that I used to export Background image, name, released, metacritic, website, description metacritc_URL and arrays of genres parent_platforms publisher’s ratings trailers and screenshots. Next, I made an export interface with the APIResonpse with a dynamic type of T. Those were all the models need to use this application. I used and created 3 different interceptors and on an application level, which consisted of http-errors.interceptors.ts, http-headers.interceptors.ts and finally http-params.interceptor.ts. In my http errors interceptor, I made an injectable with an export class of httpErrorsInterceptor this class implements the HttpInterceptor with a constructor, making an interceptor with params of HttpRequest, and HttpHandler which then returns an Observable with an HttpEvent of any. I set a pipe so that it can catch my errors. My HttpHeader and HttpParams get almost the same parameters as the HttpErrorsInterceptors with slight differences. The Header.Interceptor gets a request for a clone, and this is where I implemented my rapid API keys and host which comes from a free public API key from rapidApi.com, then I added some setParams with a key which then returns the next handled request. In my app.module.ts file in the providers array we provide the interceptors. In the home component I have a contractor with private HttpService and ActivatedRoute angular service. Making a search game method with 2 parameters SearchGame from the metacritc to supply the ratings of the games. And least the SearchGame method which calls for the API to get search results of the games you’re looking for. It gets two params which are sort and search this used the HttpService GetGameList method you can also subscribe if you’d like for using or getting data on your own time. If you’d like to check the API game array, it can be seen in the console with developer tools. In my home.components.html file I used the ngFor to loop through all the games and display them.

										In my asset’s images platform, I put all the different SVG icons for the platforms that support each game, which we can access through the SVG extension with an alt of slug. To make the drop-down menu work to search on the specific criteria I used a SelectionChange event which has a parameter of SearchGames. Doing this gives us updated results for the drop-down menu. I made a click event in my home.component.html which was called openGameDetails and it get a param of game.ID. Next, I created a redirect router to be able to open the details page and see things like description, snapshots, ratings and videos. I implemented that function in a constructor called private router.

										I made a ngOnDestroy interface method which checks for subscriptions and if there are duplicates, they will be terminated. I used the cli to make the details page where I made a route for the detail’s component. This consists of images, details of the games. I used a getColor method to animate the ratings of the game widget along with a score out of 100. To make my page dynamic I went inside my details component I made some variables from the game.ID route, I then injected a activatedRoute in my constructor that provides the API calls to have communication. Using a GetGameDetails to also uses a route from this.HttpService. From these responses we can receive the games we are searching for. I defined the the GetGameDetails in the Http.Service.ts file, gets and ID and observable game methods getting the information from the base-url from a gameInfoRequest using http get calls. This request gives the games video clips and screen shots, I used a return type of forkJoin to retrieve all the Get methods to combine them into one. Using the pipe to map the response. Next, I used the angular cli in the terminal to generate the game-tabs. Reviving about the game, publishers, and any links website with related descriptions of our games. I used mat-icons to give another rating votes of thumbs up or down. In my child element in my game-tabs component I implemented an Input method which come from the type of game and from the Game component. In my details components I set all the variables with either ngIf or ngFor to loop through all my components with specified parameters to get good reliable information. Now the angular 11 Web application is finished we have a dynamic site which has photos, videos, descriptions, ratings, genres, and publishers which has hyperlinks to link you to the actual game publisher. Search functions where you can search over 500,000 + available games using a public free API key from rapidapi.com

									</p>
									<p class="mb-0">This is a Angular video Game dashboard which has games from every console, lastest updates scores and ratings. Along with short video clicks of the game you've searched
										I learn how to how to set up a project using Angular CLI, how to create components, how to make http calls, how to implement http interceptors, how to make services.
										Also I learned how to set up routes for your application and how to pass data with routes between the components. I learn to use pipes and various Angular directives like ngFor, ngIf, and more.
